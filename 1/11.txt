I would test the program submitting something with a known number of words, lines, and tabs to see if the results matched my expectations. Conditions that I think would be most likely to cause bugs would be situations that I would not expect to typically see as input. I would think that inputs that begin and/or end with combinations of multiple spaces, newslines, or tabs would be most likely to cause issues with the counting procedure.

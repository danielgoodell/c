The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. Your question was:

> When I get out of high school I want to be a pundit. They get mentioned
> in the news allot like politicians and bombers and soldiers but I don't
> think they have to kill people. Can you tell me some good ones to get
> me started? All I have now is that stale one about "no pun in ten did."
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} When I was young, I wanted to be a pop star. I was Adam Ant.
}
} Later I changed my mind and wanted to be a DJ, until my friends told me
} to jacket.
}
} Then I wanted to become a mathematician. It was an integral part of my
} life.
}
} I told my career advisor I wanted to become a chemist. No reaction.
}
} She suggested I became a telescope manufacturer instead. I said I'd
} look into it.
}
} I took a temp job making mirrors for telescopes, but my first one went
} wrong. It reflected badly on me.
}
} At university, I wanted to be a historian until I realised there was no
} future in it.
}
} I took a part time job in a Greek restaurant. I had a smashing time.
}
} I had a job as transport manager for an orchestra. That took a lot of
} brass.
}
} I was a magician's assistant for about a year before I decided I didn't
} like being tied down.
}
} I worked in an Apple store for a while before the sexism drove me out.
} It wasn't very PC.
}
} In the end I wanted to become a priest until I learned I wouldn't make
} a prophet.
}
} Then I became a philosopher. At last I had found my Nietzsche.
}
} You owe the Oracle a career map for a cartographer.

The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. Your question was:

> I like to report a bug for no reason.  All the Questions and Answers
> come equipped with one extra blank line each.
>
> Thanks in advance.
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} There is no such thing as an extra blank line. You can use them to
} make comments in red that refer to the line above (or the line below).
} In poor nations, they run the paper through the printer again and
} the second set of Q and A fill the blank lines with untold wisdom.
} Medieval monks used them to write extra copies of the Bible at
} little to no cost for materials. If Fermat had had some blank lines,
} he could have shown his proof to all who followed. Some say
} they waste trees, but they're absolutely wrong. Cut up a sheet of
} paper, separate the blank lines from the others, and you can
} make your own tree. You can even put dollar amounts on your
} bank statement and make a little extra cash. (But don't over do it)
} If all of the blank lines were laid end to end, they would reach the
} end of the universe (almost). The most important thing small
} children learn in school is how to wait in line. It is the fabric of
} our society and keeps it from falling apart. Now that you know the
} potential value of blank lines, I am going to give you one:
}
} You owe the Oracle something spectacular on the blank line above.
} Don't let me down.

The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. Your question was:

> Know any good shaggy dog stories?  Or shaggy god stories?
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} Yes, as a matter of fact I do!
}
} So this one day Balder the Beautiful was combing his hair. Yeah, I
} know: shocker! I mean, you know Balder! Blonde, long haired, pretty
} much useless if not for his kick-ass combat abilities and his complete
} invulnerability to everything except mistletoe. I mean, what's that
} about? Who has a vulnerability to mistletoe, right? Well, Balder
} figured that it was so out there in left field that only a real
} switch-hitter would nail the mistletoe thing.
}
} Yeah, right. He forgot all about Loki! I mean, we ALL forgot about
} Loki! When he lost that bet with the Niebelungs and got his mouth sewn
} shut we figured he wouldn't dare show his face in Valhalla for
} thousands of years! I mean, Odin requires all his guests to laugh
} REALLY loud while they're partying, and it's a little bit difficult to
} laugh out loud with your lips sewn together, you know what I mean? Of
} course you do!
}
} So anyway, we're all SMASHED out of our minds on some real primo mead
} that Heimdall brought along. I think he brought about ten thousand
} barrels of the stuff. Really kickass stuff. So, we're all drunk. Odin's
} in the back bedroom getting a lapdance from one of the Valkyrie. Next
} thing you know, there's Loki. No stitches. Mouth operational. Thor was
} passed out or he would have smashed his face in. He hates Loki,
} especially since Loki drew that picture on the side of the mountain of
} Thor dressed as Ballerina Barbie.
}
} So anyway, Loki starts making these loud boasts about how all the gods
} of Asgard are totally invulnerable except Balder, who he says is just
} pretty and that's about it, right? Well, Balder gets pissed. Odin comes
} out, Thor wakes up. It's really intense. Like, I mean Clint Eastwood
} spaghetti western kind of intense, right? So anyway, Odin says, "All
} right, let's have a 'Throw Things At Balder' contest!"
}
} Of course, he probably should have said, "Let's* take turns* throwing
} things at Balder," because the next thing you know, every stick of
} furniture in the drinking hall, every joint of mutton in Valhalla,
} fruit, dwarves, pots and pans and drinking horns and a couple of Volvos
} go flying right at Balder. Well, we managed to get the place cleaned
} up, and Odin says, "All right, let's try that again, you momos!"
}
} So we all took turns. It was kind of predictable. Thor throws his
} hammer, Tyr didn't throw anything because that giant wolf ate his right
} hand, Freya threw an implant, Sif threw some hair care products, etc.
} Well, everyone took their turn and Balder stood there, unscathed,
} right? Well, we forgot about Hodr, the Blind God. Loki says to him,
} "Don't worry! I'll point your hands in the right direction, and let's
} throw.....um.....this branch!"
}
} Yeah.....that vulnerability to everything except mistletoe? I mean who
} knew, right? If I had a chance to be invulnerable to everything except
} one thing, I'd probably choose mistletoe, too! How often do you even
} see that stuff except at Christmas, and then it's usually made from
} plastic, right? So Balder probably figured, "Hey! Christmas was months
} ago! I'm cool!"
}
} Yeah, so the mistletoe pierced his chest. He yelled. A lot. He rolled
} around in pain for quite a while. Then he died, of course. But let me
} tell ya: Not one hair out of place! Now that was a shaggy god!

The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. Your question was:

> Cheese and rice, what was that for!
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} It is a euphemism, intended for the moment when you hit your thumb with
} a hammer. Instead of yelling, "Jeeeezzuss Chriiist" (which would be
} blasphemy) you instead yell cheese and rice.
}
} Your next problem is how to overcome the pain in your thumb. The
} solution is to drop the hammer. It falls on your foot. You then ignore
} the blasphemic problem, and not only yell the Name of Our Blessed Lord
} And Saviour, but scream the added information that His middle initial
} is H and that He is engaging in unspeakable acts beginning with the
} letter F.
}
} At this point you are testing the very limits of the concepts of
} Infinite Mercy and of Divine Retribution. Your faith in Cheese and
} Rice, your prior Good Works, and your status as one of The Elect all
} come into play, as the question of Salvation swirls about you as the
} Whirlwind about Job.
}
} If you happen to be Buddhist instead of Christian, your Karma will
} still be messed up, and you'll be headed off into a set of dreadful
} reincarnations that you would be better off not knowing. The world's
} various religions work more closely together than you could ever
} imagine, even when you hear their proponents proclaiming the opposite.
} (Such is the Mystery of religious mystery.)
}
} You owe the Oracle the power to resist telling the joke with the
} punchline, "That was Zen, this is Tao."

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} Unfortunately you have happened upon a British incarnation, who is
} un-American by definition. What follows may be somewhat confused.
}
} Between 1949 and 1954 Senator McCarthy headed three bodies in charge of
} rooting out Communicationists. These were called the House Committee on
} Communication Perversions (HCCP, later known as HTTP), the Senate
} Internet Security Subcommittee, and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee
} on Inveigling.
}
} McCarthy had heard of the invention of the Internet by Karl Marx, who
} later gave his name to the Hierarchical Traitors Marxist Language, or
} HTML for short. McCarthy realised that, since HTTP was a state-free
} communication strategy, it was pushing for the overthrow of the United
} States, and could undermine American life as he knew it. He therefore
} started a series of investigations into un-American activities, which
} were designed to discover citizens who were not loyal to the USA. On
} account of the citizens being caught in this drag-net (not to be
} confused with stockings for transvestites), they were often referred to
} as netizens.
}
} The main question of these investigations was famously: "Are you now,
} or have you ever been, party to internet communications?" Many in the
} entertainment industry, who were keen for their films and music to be
} freely available to everyone (via the Redistribution of Internet
} Archives Association (RIAA)), were caught up in this mess.
}
} Every day, lists would be posted of those who had been found guilty of
} un-American activities, and everyone was forbidden from doing business
} with them. This practice was known as Duns Blacklisting, after the
} philosopher Duns Scotus (Dunce of Scotland).
}
} Eventually, of course, McCarthyism was stopped.
}
} And so it was, in 1969, that Senator Gore (father of the father of an
} inconvenient truth about socialist climate change) rediscovered the
} unbridled communication possibilities afforded by the Internet. He
} publicised these, but did so on the Internet, which was then only
} accessible to three Amish heretics and a shopkeeper in Salt Lake City.
}
} Ever since, the Internet has been used primarily for good.
}
} You owe the Oracle an essay on the fishing conflicts between the USSR
} and the USA which started around Christmas 1948, entitled "The Cod
} (Noel) War".

} that axle will bend into a smile. And won't that look nice? Actually,
} no it won't, because the Mercer will be undriveable and worthless. Ha!
} That's what you get for refusing to let me drive it.
}
} Anyway, other strange units from the world of spell-correction include:
}
} Jewels per secundum: It's a little known fact that James Watt was an
} opportunistic thief who picked up bracelets and rings dropped by women
} he was stalking. (To suggest that he got off very lightly when he

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} Go big or go home. When you're coming up with the most original of
} sins, there is a major need to be, well, original. Unfortunately, the
} incredible length and breadth of human history behind you makes this
} incredibly difficult. Your best bet is to take one of the major
} *existing *categories of sin, and add one of the major *intensifiers*
} of sin that would not normally go with it.
}
} For example, take a simple ACT OF THEFT but apply an extra layer of
} LOST DIGNITY. Take a PERVERSE SEXUAL ACT and tack on some OCCULT
} BEHAVIORS. Or go with the tried and true COVETING OF YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
} (x) and add a modern twist of ILL-DEFINED DIGITAL 'ABUSE'.
}
} In no time, your priest will be assigning tens or hundreds of obscure
} Latinate prayers due to... (*contemplates variables*) the time you
} stole a sex toy from a relative... in order to invoke a South Asian
} demon-spirit so that using it felt like... the shifter-handle of your
} boss' new car that you saw while stalking his Facebook.
}
} Good luck and good sinning! Well. Bad sinning. But you know what I
